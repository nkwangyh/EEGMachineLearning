# MachineLearning
This is a machine learning solution for EEG recognition of human mental state.
The project is in Matlab/Octave.
The entry point of the project is EEG_recog.m
There are two pieces of raw EEG data in the project. Both of them are under the data folder, in which the first is "data_0.txt" and "data_1.txt" which is relatively small, and the second is the rest text files under the data folder which is large enough to train the models.
In the folder tempData, there are some temperary data which was a copy when I was tuning the parameters. And the corresponding result screenshots are in the folder Screenshot. To observe the result, you can simply run the tuning functions while taking the temperaty data files as parameters.
