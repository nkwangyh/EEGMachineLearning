# MachineLearning
This is a machine learning solution for EEG recognition of human mental state.
The project is in Matlab/Octave.
The entry point of the project is EEG_recog.m
There are two pieces of raw EEG data in the project, the first is "data_0.txt" and "data_1.txt" which is relatively small, and the second is the rest text files under the data folder which is large enough to train the models.
